# kicad-lib - Symbol and footprint libraries for KiCad

This repository contains my personal library for KiCad projects.

## How to use

Add this repository as a submodule to your project. I personally put the folder of the cloned
repository as `kicad-lib` next to my the KiCad project folders and add symlinks to the provided
`fp-lib-table` and `sym-lib-table` into each project folder. However, this will prevent you from
using other libraries as project-specific libraries. Since I put all my parts into kicad-lib, this
is fine with me.
